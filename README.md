## Simple Pokedex

Fun project created with React using RESTful [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/). It is a Progressive Web App and despite it is available [online](https://pbroniarczyk.github.io/pokedex/) still requires some work (there is practically no design only basics UI elements, requests are quite slow sometimes and there are some minor bugs on witch I am working on). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
